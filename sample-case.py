sample_full_text = "Mr. Justice Roberts\ndelivered the opinion of the , Court.\nThe Court ot Appeals of the District of Columbia has certified the following questions:\n“ Question No. 1: Where on a criminal indictment a demurrer is sustained and the indictment quashed on' two grounds, one involving a construction of the statute and the other the interpretation of the indictment as a pleading, will an appeal lie at the instance of the United Slates from the trial court of the District of Columbia to the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia?\n“ If Question No. 1 be answered in the affirmative, then\n“Question No. 2: May the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia on such appeal review the ruling of the trial court based on the construction of the statute?’’\nWe are advised by the certificate that the defendants were indicted by a grand jury of the District of Columbia for violation of the Federal Corrupt Practices Act. They , interposed a demurrer asserting that the conduct imputed to them did not constitute the offense defined by the Act, and that, in any .event, the indictment was insufficient as a pleading in omitting to aver knowledge on the part of the defendants, which was claimed to be an essential element of the crime. From a judgment of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia sustaining^ the demurrer and quashing the indictment, the Government appealed to the Court of Appeals. The appellees contended.that court lacked jurisdiction, .since the Criminal Appeals Act governs the right of review in such cases and permits, only, a direct appeal to this court. The solution of the questions propounded therefore requires that we answer another: Does the Criminal Appeals Act embrace cases triable in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia?\nIn the absence of express statutory authority no appeal may be taken on behalf of the United States in any criminal case. United States v. Sanges, 144 U.S. 310; United States v. Ainsworth, 3 App.D.C. 483. March 3, 1901, Congress adopted the Code of Law for the District of Columbia, whereby it defined the jurisdiction of the Police Court and the Supreme Court of the District, sanctioned appeals from both to the Court of Appeals, and by § 935 enacted:\n“ In all criminal prosecutions the United States or the District of Columbia, as the casé may be, shall have the same right of appeal that is given to the defendant, including the right to'a bill of exceptions: Provided, That if on such appeal it shall be found that there was error in the rulings of the court, during the trial, a verdict in favor of the defendant shall not be set aside.”\nTlie Criminal Appeals Act was not adopted uhtil 1907. It authorized a writ of. error (now an appeal) “ by and on behalf of the United States from the district or circuit courts direct to ” this court “ in all criminal cases, in the following.instances.” Three classes are enumerated: decisions quashing or sustaining a demurrer to an indictment, based upon the invalidity, or construction of the statute on ..which the indictment is founded; decisions arresting judgment for insufficiency of the. indictment, based upon such invalidity, or construction of the statute; and décisions . sustaining a' special plea iñ bar when the defendant has not been put in jeopardy. No appeal is permitted , where, there has been a verdict in favor of the defendant.. The Court of Appeals, holding this Act, so far as applicable,- superseded § 935 of the District Code, desires, a ruling as to its jurisdiction on appeal where a decisión will involve both a construction of the statute on which the indictment is based and a ruling as to the validity of the indictment-as a pleading.- We think, however, the answer is clear; for we are of opinion that; the Criminal Appeals Act is inapplicable to criminal cases tried in the Supreme Court of the District. These are regulated solely by § 935 of the Code.\nIt is said that the Criminal Appeals Act is pertinent because the Code provides that the Supreme Court is to be “ deemed a court of the United States ” (compare Embry v. Palmer, 107 U.S. 3), but designation of a tribunal as a court of the United States, does not constitute it a district court. In re Mills, 135 U.S. 263, 267-8; Stephens v. Cherokee Nation, 174 U.S. 445.\nAppellees further urge the' statement in the Code. that the Supreme Court “ shall posses^ the same powers and exercise the same jurisdiction as the district courts of the United States ” has the effect, of máking it a district court as that phrase is used in the Criminal Appeals Act. Where a statute uses this or similar language to define the jurisdiction'of a court, such a.court is authorized to try statutory actions declared to be cognizable by district courts, as if the tribunal were in fact a district court of the United States. And the same rule is applicable to appellate proceedings. Compare In re Cooper, 143 U.S. 472, 494; Hine v. Morse, 218 U.S. 493; Federal Trade Commission v. Klesner, 274 U.S. 145, 154; United States v. California Cooperative Canneries, 279 U.S. 553, 558. But vesting a court with “the same jurisdiction as is vésted in district courts ” does not make it a district . court -of the United. States.'. This has been repeatedly said with reference, to territorial, courts. Reynolds v. United States, 98 U.S. 145, 154; Stephens v. Cherokee Nation, supra, p. 476; Summers v. United States, 231 U.S. 92, 101.\n. The Criminal Appeals, Act, in naming the'courts from which appeals may be taken to this court’, employs the phrase.“ district courts”; not'“courts of the United States,” • or “ courts exercising the same jurisdiction as district ‘ courts.” We . heed not, ’ however, determine whether the statute should be construed to embrace. criminal cases tried in the-Supreme Court of the District’ if § 935 of the District Code’ were not in effect. That section deals comprehensively with appeals in criminal cases from all of the courts of first instance, of the District and confers on the Court of Appeals jurisdiction of appeals by the Government seeking review of the judgments of those courts. The Criminal. Appeals Act, bn the other hand, affects only certain specified classes of decisions in district courts, contains ■ no repealing clause, and no reference to the courts of the District of Columbia or the territorial courts, upon many of which jurisdiction is conferred by language quite similar to that of the Code of Law of the District. We cannot construe it as impliedly repealing the complete appellate, system created for thé District of Columbia by § 935 of the Code, in the absence of expression on the part of Congress -indicating that purpose. Implied repeals are not favored; and if effect can reasonably be given to both, statutes, the presumption is that the earlier is intended to remain in force. Frost v. Wenie, 157. U.S. 46, 58; United States v. Healey, 160 U.S. 136, 147; United States v. Greathouse, 166 U.S. 601, 605; Petri v. Creelman Lumber Co., 199 U.S. 487, 497; Ex parte United States, 226 U.S. 420, 424; Washington v. Miller, 235 U.S. 422, 428.\nThe Court of Appeals has jurisdiction of both issues presented by the appeal from the decree of the Supreme Court. -' '\nQuestion No. 1 answered “ Yesl’\nQuestion No. 2 answered “ Yes.”\nMr. Justice Cahdozo concurs in the result.\nAct of February .28, 1925; U.S.C., Tit/ 2, Chap. 8.\nAct of March 2, 1907; 34 Stat. 1246; -U.S.C., Tit. 18, § .682.\n31 Stat. 1189.\n31 Stat. 1341. By the Act of March 19,1906, 34'Stat. 73, a Juvenile Court was established and appeals from its judgments to the Court of Appeals authorized and regulated.\nIn United States v. Evans, 28 App.D.C. 264, approved 213 U.S. 297, it was held that the proviso was ineffective to afford the Gov- • ernment a review-of alleged errors in the course of a trial resulting in acquittal.\nSee United States v.
